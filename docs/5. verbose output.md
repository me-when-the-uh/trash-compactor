# Verbose Output

Trash-compactor provides a tiered verbosity system to control the level of detail in its output. This allows users to switch between a clean interactive interface, a script-friendly summary, or deep diagnostic logging for troubleshooting.

## Level 0: Interactive Mode (Default)

When no verbosity flag is provided, the program defaults to **Level 0**. This mode is designed for human interaction in a terminal.

It displays a dynamic progress timer during the file scanning phase and progress bars during the compression stages. These UI elements update in place to show the current status without flooding the console history.

At the end of the operation, a concise summary of the compression results is printed.

## Level 1: Scripting & Entropy Mode (-v)

**Level 1** disables the interactive UI elements (progress timers and progress bars), making it suitable for automated scripts or logging to a file.

In addition to the final summary, this level now includes detailed reporting on the entropy analysis and directory filtering process. It logs specific decisions made by the entropy filter, such as which directories were skipped because their estimated savings fell below the configured threshold.

## Level 2: Verification Warnings (-vv)

**Level 2** includes everything from Level 1 and adds warnings for files that were successfully processed by the compression tool but did not result in any size reduction.

These files are reported with a warning message and are **excluded** from the final compression statistics to provide a more accurate picture of effective compression.

## Level 3: Skip Diagnostics (-vvv)

**Level 3** expands the reporting to include details about skipped content.

It lists the specific directories that were excluded from processing, along with the reasoning (e.g., high entropy or system protection). This is useful for verifying that the "guardrails" are behaving as expected and not excluding important data.

## Level 4: Debug Mode (-vvvv)

**Level 4** enables full debug logging. This is the most verbose mode and is intended for developers or deep troubleshooting.

It logs every significant action taken by the program, including:
*   Individual file compression results (success, failure, or skip).
*   Detailed entropy samples for every directory analyzed.
*   Specific reasons for skipping individual files (e.g., extension, size, or existing compression).
*   System directories that were protected from modification.

In dry-run mode, Level 4 includes all entropy samples in the final report, not just those that would have triggered compression.
